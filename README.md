null
====

A minimal standalone app for Stackato for exploration and testing.

This app does nothing but provide a container for inspection and testing.

## Deploying to Stackato

    $ git clone git://github.com/Stackato-Apps/null.git
    $ cd null
    $ stackato push -n

## SSH to Container

Once the app has been deployed, use the `stackato` client to open an SSH session to the container.

    $ stackato ssh -a null
    null:~$
